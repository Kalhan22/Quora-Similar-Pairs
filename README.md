All the scripts have been used to make submission on Kaggle. Each script is named after the type of machine learning technique used for experimentation. For-example, NNET.R has been used to experiment with Neural Networks and similarly all the other files have been named accordingly.

The scripts may require installation of several librries. Also the location of files may need to be changed.

Please contact the author Kalhan Dhar(email: kdhar@uwaterloo.ca) for help in running the scripts.
